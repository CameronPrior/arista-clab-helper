# Arista ContainerLab Helper

## Disclaimer!
I'll start by saying that I am not a developer, nor do I resemble anything close to a developer.
The code you will find in this repository is most likely offensive to developers everywhere and for that I apologise.

# Exec Summary
This 'code' is designed to help you deploy, destroy and inspect topologies in ContainerLab.
Features include:
- Deploy 2 different Arista based topologies (with or without attached Hosts)
- Automatic provisioning into CloudVision (CVP) if required
- Destroy any running lab and perform either a full clean-up or leave the files intact for next time
- Inspect all running labs

# Requirements
Obviously ContainerLab is required in order for this to work, if you haven't already done this you should head over to the ContainerLab site and follow [this](https://containerlab.dev/install/) guide.

You will also need a cEOS image which can be downloaded from the [Arista website.](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download)
Once downloaded you will need to import that image into ContainerLab, to do this you need to use the `docker import {CEOS FILENAME} {IMAGE NAME}` command, e.g. `docker import cEOS-lab-4.29.0F.tar ceos:4.29.0F`.
This command imports the container image that you downloaded and saves it into the docker image repository using the *image_name* you have given it.
You need to follow the correct image naming standard of ceos:#.##.##.

**Please Note:** Its best to avoid CEOS images prior to *CEOS-4.28.0F* as they might not boot depending on the runtime environment. More info on this limitation can be found [here](https://containerlab.dev/manual/kinds/ceos/#known-issues-or-limitations)

Next up would be a functioning version of Python (This was written in version 3.10.6 but I'm fairly certain it will run on most version 3+). 
You should also be installing [python-pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) as you will be using that to install the external modules required.

I have utilised three external python modules in this script:
- [cvPrac](https://github.com/aristanetworks/cvprac) - Which is a RESTful API client for CloudvisionÂ® Portal (CVP) which can be used for building applications that work with Arista CVP
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - The python HTTP library
- [docker](https://pypi.org/project/docker/) - A python library for the Docker Engine API


Once you have installed ContainerLab, Python and Python-pip. You can go ahead and either clone the repository or download the zip and extract it into a folder of your choosing.
I've created a clab-helper folder within the containerlab directory which is found in your user directory.

You will then want to run `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` which will install the three external modules listed above.

# Usage
ContainerLab requires elevated privileges so you will need to run the script with sudo.
`sudo Python3 clab-helper.py` should get you started.

Assuming everything has gone well you will be presented with a menu giving you the option to Deploy, Destroy, Inspect or Quit.
From here everything is pretty self explanatory.

The script will ask you what type of lab you would like to deploy, then it will gather various information for said lab.
If you select to deploy a lab with Hosts attached, it will ask what image you would like to use for the hosts.
If this image does not exist, it will use docker to download the image.


# Topologies
The following topologies are included:

### Single Data Center with MLAG

### Single Data Center with MLAG and Attached Hosts

### Dual Data Center with MLAG

# CloudVision Setup
In order to use CVP with ContainerLab, the CVP host needs a static route configured back to the management range.
When configuring CVP, I used the same interface for both the Cluster Interface and the Device Interface.
After CVP is up and running, add a static route using the `ip route add {MANAGEMENT RANGE} via {DOCKER HOST IP} dev eth0` command.
